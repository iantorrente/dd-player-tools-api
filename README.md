# D&D Character Creator API
This is the API for the D&D Character Creator frontend that can be found here: https://github.com/iantorrente/dd-player-tools
As of writing this (6/25/19) there are only four endpoints that only allow `GET` requests, but I'm looking into expanding the database's functionality to allow users to `POST` and `PUT` to those endpoints.
